- Framework: Vertex AI Agent Builder + Dialogflow
- Language: Python 3.9+
- AVOID: Multi-platform complexity, tool sprawl

**Time Structure:**
- 2 hours/day split: 1-hour morning sprint (core building) + 1-hour evening sprint (testing/polish)
- ADHD-optimized: 35-minute focused sprints with breaks, visual progress tracking, micro-rewards
